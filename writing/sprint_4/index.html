        </h2>
<p>Dear Mr. Smith,</p>
<p>I hope this email finds you well.</p>
<p>I am writing to you today to discuss the recent proposal that you sent over. I have reviewed it carefully and I have a few concerns.</p>
<p>First, I am not sure that we are on the same page with regards to the budget.<br>
In your proposal, you state that the project will cost $100,000. However, our budget is only $50,000.<br>
I would need to see some evidence to support your claim that the project will only cost $100,000.</p>
<p>Second, I am concerned about the timeline for the project.<br>
In your proposal, you state that the project will be completed in 6 months.<br>
However, we need the project to be completed in 3 months.<br>
I would need to see a revised timeline that shows how you can complete the project in 3 months.</p>
<p>Finally, I am concerned about the quality of the work that will be done.<br>
In your proposal, you state that you have a team of experienced professionals who will be working on the project.<br>
However, I would need to see some evidence to support this claim. I would need to see references from previous clients and I would need to see examples of the work that your team has done in the past.</p>
<p>I would appreciate it if you could address these concerns in your reply.<br>
I would also like to schedule a meeting to discuss the project in more detail.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>John Doe</p>
