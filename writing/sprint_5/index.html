          Topic:â€¯Request to work on-site.
        </h2>
<p>Dear Stark,</p>
<p>I am writing this email to request work on-site at our office.Since all have been working from home for the past two years,<br>
and appreciate the flexibility, Here finding that I am less productive and more isolated.</p>
<p>So believe that working on-site would allow me to be more productive and collaborate more effectively with my team members.<br>
Also would be able to access resources that are not available to me at home, such as our library and our in-house training programs.</p>
<p>I understand that you may have some concerns about me working on-site.<br>
But also would like to address these concerns by saying that I have fully vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19.</p>
<p>It can be appreciated if you would consider my request to work on-site.<br>
And believing that it would be beneficial for both me and the company.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Robert</p>
