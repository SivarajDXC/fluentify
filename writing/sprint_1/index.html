          If you’re an SDE and you are working on the UI Design of the App. Now
          your lead has asked you to give updates of your tasks in an email.
          You’ve created 2 Screen UIs and their Frontend and Backend
          functionality. The auto-layout is giving a little problem but the
          backend logic is working fine and the Frontend UI needs some work.

        <p>Dear Jackie,</p>
        <p>
          I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to provide you with an
          update on the progress of my tasks regarding the UI design of the iOS
          app we are working on.“I have successfully created two screen UIs and
          implemented the necessary frontend and backend functionality for
          them.” The backend logic is working flawlessly, and I am pleased with
          the functionality achieved so far.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, I am encountering some challenges with the autolayout, which
          is causing minor issues in the UI presentation.While the backend
          functionality is solid, I acknowledge that the frontend UI requires
          further attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          I plan to dedicate more time to refine the UI components, ensuring a
          seamless and visually appealing user experience. I will address the
          autolayout issues promptly to enhance the overall UI responsiveness
          and consistency.“I am actively exploring solutions to resolve the
          autolayout problem and will communicate with the UI/UX team to seek
          their expertise and guidance.” Rest assured, I am committed to
          delivering a polished and user-friendly interface for the iOS app.
        </p>
        <p>Thank you for your support and guidance throughout this process.</p>
        <p>
          I will continue to provide updates on my progress and welcome any
          feedback or suggestions you may have.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your expertise and insights are highly valued and will contribute to
          the success of our project.
        </p>
        <p>Thank you,</p>
