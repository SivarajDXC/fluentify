      <h1> What Is iOS Development? </h1>
      <p>
        In a few words, iOS development is the process of building apps designed for Apple’s operating system. 
        iOS development involves creative device applications used for iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A major element of iOS development is the mastery of either of the 2 programming languages: Swift and Objective-C. 
        Between the 2, Swift is easier to learn and read like Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, and C++. It’s also a high-level 
        programming language that has security and performance as it’s the highest concern making it 2.6 times faster than Objective-C. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Objective-C on the other hand is a general-purpose iOS programming language that’s a superset of the C language. 
        Apple applications developed under this programming language have object-oriented capabilities. 
        Simply put, these apps organize software design on objects or data instead of logic and functions. 
        Most developers opt to maintain their legacy applications in this language rather than integrating them into the Swift framework.  
      </p>
      <p>
        What makes iOS development striking is that it’s not open-source like Android apps. Moreover, 
        unlike desktop applications that use massive power and storage, iOS apps need to be made lighter 
        as installable software because it lives on mobile phones and iPads, devices that aren’t as powerful 
        or that don’t have as much storage as desktop computers have. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To make that easier to understand, imagine a translation app. When designed for computers, these 
        types of apps run locally (in the computer itself) because they can manage a large database. 
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, a translation app made for iOS devices needs to be light. When you make a query from 
        an iOS app, the query is sent to a remote platform that does the actual translation and sent back to your 
        device for you to read. Simply said, iOS apps are mostly touchpoints where users interact but not the actual 
        device where the computing happens. 
      </p>
      <p>
        More than just the mastery of Swift, Objective-C, and creating lightweight apps, there are more technical 
        requirements for iOS development. Let’s delve deeper into each one in the next section. 
      </p>
      <h2 id="7 iOS App Development Requirements:">
        7 iOS App Development Requirements: 
      </h2>
      <p>
        Before you start to write code for developing iOS applications, you’ll need to have or prepare these requirements. 
      </p>
      <h3 id="1. Have A Mac Computer:">
        1. Have A Mac Computer 
      </h3>
      <p> 
        One of the most important requirements in building an iOS application is to have a Mac computer. 
        You’ll need a Mac so that you can run Xcode 14 (more on this later. iOS app development is so much 
        easier when created in the same ecosystem.It’s best to have at least an Intel i5 (or an equivalent CPU version) 
        and at least 2. GHz. While you can run apps on 8 GB RAM, a bigger capacity allows you to run more apps 
        simultaneously without the dreaded lag. You’ll also need at least 256 GB of disk space though a 512 GB storage is what I recommend. 
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if a Mac is too much for your budget, does that mean you can’t be an iOS app developer? Not exactly. 
        You can also develop an iOS app with a Windows or Linux operating system if you use a VMWare or Virtual Box, a USB 2.0, 
        have an Apple Developer account, and use Xcode 10.1. But as you can see, you’ll be using the older Xcode version which 
        means you’ll need to make an update sooner than if you develop your iOS app in the latest Xcode version.  
      </p>
      <h4 id= "2. Master Xcode:">
        2. Master Xcode
      </h4>
      <p>
        Next, iOS application development requires expertise in Xcode. This is an integrated development environment, 
        IDE as some call it, for macOS. You can download this for free on the Mac App store. For the latest version 
        (XCode 14), you’ll need to have an operating system that’s at least running on macOS Monterey 12.4.  
      </p>
      <h5 id= "3. Create An Apple Developer Account :">
        3. Create An Apple Developer Account 
      </h5>
      <p>
        When developing an iOS app you’ll need to have your personal Apple Developer account. Only active members can publish an 
        app in Apple’s App store. This will entail a bit of cost. There’s the Apple Developer program that costs $99/year. 
        There’s also an enterprise version priced at $299/year. Depending on where you’re located the actual fee may vary 
        because of the local currency. 
      </p>
      <h6 id= "4. Knowledge Of APIs and Libraries  :">
        4. Knowledge Of APIs and Libraries  
      </h6>
      <p>
        iOS development also entails knowing about APIs and libraries. With standardization, functionality, and consistency in 
        mind, Apple released native APIs and libraries that are easy to use, stable, and feature-rich.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should also know about SDKs (software development kits) because it helps in the seamless integration of your app 
        into the existing infrastructure.Some of the most essential are the Cocoa Touch frameworks which include GameKit, UIKit, 
        MapKit, PushKit, and Foundation Kit.
      </p>
      <h7 id= "<h6 id= "5. Knowledge Of Cloud Expansion :">
        4. 5. Knowledge Of Cloud Expansion  
      </h7>
      <p>
        As mentioned earlier, mobile devices can only handle so much. While iPhones are powerful devices, it’s best to 
        offload resource-intensive tasks to the cloud. iOS development involves learning how to connect your app to cloud-based 
        services using APIs. This allows you to leverage the cloud not just for storage purposes but also for database management, 
        app caching, and augmentation with net-generation services. 
      </p>
      <h8 id= "6. Master Code Testing ">
        6. Master Code Testing 
      </h8>
      <p>
        After completing the iOS application development, code testing ensures it runs smoothly and as expected. 
        Hence, a crucial part of iOS development is the testing stage. Note that even iOS programmers with years of 
        experience make mistakes so every iOS app needs to undergo testing before the actual deployment. 
      </p>
      <p>    
        The first thing that needs testing is the Xcode. Your iOS app should undergo standard unit testing along with automated 
        UI testing. This will involve writing tests that navigate through your UI and interacting with the iOS software just like 
        a user to locate any issue that might occur at any touchpoint. 
      </p>
      <p>
       While UI testing simulates a real user’s dealings with your app (given that you cover all the aspects), beta testing, 
       or actual human testing of your app will be very vital. Apple comes with a TestFlight app where 25 members from an iOS 
       coder with an Apple Developer Program membership can test the apps for up to 30 devices each. This allows development teams, 
       friends, family, and the existing user base to test the actual app interaction with humans.At this point, you can test the 
       data storage using Core Data, network calls to 3rd party APIs, and push notifications.  
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if sourcing our physical devices poses a logistical challenge, cloud testing is a good option to take. 
       Even though done on the cloud, it allows for testing on different operating system versions, carrier firmware, 
       and manufacturer modifications that can potentially lead to unexpected problems. With this type of testing, you 
       can do manual tests or automated tests to ensure the quality and smooth interaction of users with your iOS application. 
      </p>
      <h9 id= "7. Patience During Deployment ">
        7. Patience During Deployment
      </h9>
      <p>
       After passing the testing stage, the iOS app is now ready for deployment to the App store. This can only be done with a 
       membership in the Apple Developer Program. With this membership, you gain access to advanced capabilities and app analytics 
       for further app performance improvements.Keep in mind that submitting your iOS app to the app store will mean letting it undergo 
       a review process. Many times, this process can take some time and require frequent and multiple interactions. The iOS app can be 
       rejected, and needs revision and resubmission multiple times, hence patience is needed.After passing this review stage you can 
       then build your App store page using App Store Connect. Another thing to keep in mind is that if you require users to pay to use 
       your app, Apple takes a 30% cut on the sales.
