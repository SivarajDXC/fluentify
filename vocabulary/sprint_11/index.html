Supply chain visibility, which refers to real-time tracking and monitoring of products, enables businesses to proactively address potential disruptions and make data-driven decisions.</p>
<p>Quality control is a critical aspect of ensuring customer satisfaction and maintaining brand reputation. It involves monitoring and assessing product quality at every stage of the production process, from raw materials to finished goods. Quality control measures aim to identify and rectify defects, ensure compliance with industry standards, and meet customer expectations. By implementing effective quality control practices, businesses can prevent quality issues, reduce rework or returns, and enhance customer loyalty.</p>
