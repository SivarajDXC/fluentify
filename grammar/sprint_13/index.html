<p>You use pronouns every day. In fact, even if you don’t know what pronouns are, you use them—and in this sentence alone, we’ve now used pronouns four times.</p>
<p>Pronouns are words (or phrases) you substitute for nouns when your reader or listener already knows which noun you’re referring to. For example, you might say, “I have a dog. She’s brown and white.” There’s no need to clarify that you’re describing your dog in the second sentence because you already mentioned her in the first. With the pronoun she’s, you can avoid annoying repetition of dog.</p>
<p>Pronouns do a whole lot more than helping us avoid repetitiveness. They provide context, make your sentences’ meanings clearer, and shape how we perceive people and things. Read on to learn about the different ways we use pronouns and how to use them to construct sentences.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-pronoun">What is a Pronoun?</h2>
<p>In English grammar, pronouns are a type of generic noun that can represent any other noun. Their job is to make communication faster and more efficient because you don’t have to repeat the same word over and over again. Some pronoun examples include:</p>
<p>I, Me, Us, you, themselves, who, that</p>
<p>Pronouns are one of the eight traditional parts of speech, and they are also sometimes understood as making up a small subcategory of nouns. The distinguishing characteristic of pronouns is that they can be substituted for nouns. For instance, if you’re telling a story about your sister Sarah, the story will begin to sound repetitive if you keep saying or writing Sarah over and over again:</p>
<p>Example : Sarah has always loved fashion. Sarah announced that Sarah wants to go to fashion school.</p>
<p>Instead, you can use the pronoun she to refer to Sarah after introducing her:</p>
<p>Example : Sarah has always loved fashion. She announced that she wants to go to fashion school.</p>
<p>Pronouns can replace both proper and common nouns. Certain pronouns have specific rules about when they can be used, such as the way it should never be used to refer to a human being. We explain all of the different types and their associated rules below. Notice that some pronouns (such as which and whose) can function as more than one type, depending on how they’re deployed in a sentence.</p>
