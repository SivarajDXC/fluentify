      <div class="stackedit__html"><h1 id="what-is-a-noun-definition-types-and-examples">What Is a Noun? Definition, Types, and Examples</h1>
<p>Nouns are everywhere in our writing. But what are all the types of nouns you come across, and how do you use them?</p>
<p>A noun is a word that names something, such as a person, place, thing, or idea. In a sentence, nouns can play the role of subject, direct object, indirect object, subject complement, object complement, appositive, or modifier.</p>
<p>Some noun examples include: Cat, Bicycle, Taylor Swift, Kuala Lumpur</p>
<h2 id="types-of-nouns">Types of nouns</h2>
<p>Nouns form a large proportion of English vocabulary, and they come in a wide variety of types.</p>
<h3 id="nouns-can-name-a-person">Nouns can name a person:</h3>
<p>Examples : Albert Einstein, the president, my mother, a girl</p>
<h3 id="nouns-can-name-a-place">Nouns can name a place:</h3>
<p>Examples : Mount Vesuvius, my Hallroom</p>
<h3 id="nouns-can-name-things">Nouns can name things:</h3>
<p>Things might include intangible things, such as concepts, activities, or processes. Some might even be hypothetical or imaginary things.</p>
<p>Examples : shoe, faucet, freedom, basketball</p>
<h2 id="proper-nouns-vs.-common-nouns">Proper nouns vs. common nouns</h2>
<p>One important distinction to be made is whether a noun is a proper noun or a common noun. A proper noun is a specific name of a person, place, or thing and is always capitalized.</p>
<p>Examples : Does Tina have much homework to do this evening?</p>
<p>Tina is the name of a specific person.</p>
<p>Examples : I would like to visit Old Faithful.</p>
<p>Old Faithful is the specific name of a geological phenomenon.</p>
<p>The opposite of a proper noun is a common noun, sometimes known as a generic noun. A common noun is the generic name of an item in a class or group and is not capitalized unless appearing at the beginning of a sentence or in a title.</p>
<p>Examples : The girl crossed the river.</p>
<p>Girl is a common noun; we do not learn the identity of the girl by reading this sentence, though we know the action she takes. River is also a common noun in this sentence.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-common-nouns">Types of common nouns</h2>
<p>Common or generic nouns can be broken down into three subtypes: concrete nouns, abstract nouns, and collective nouns. A concrete noun is something that is perceived by the senses; something that is physical or real.</p>
<p>Examples :  I heard the doorbell.</p>
<pre><code>               My keyboard is sticky. 
</code></pre>
<p>Doorbell and keyboard name real things that can be sensed.</p>
<p>Conversely, an abstract noun is something that cannot be perceived by the senses.</p>
<p>Examples :  We can’t imagine the courage it took to do that.</p>
<p>Courage is an abstract noun. Courage can’t be seen, heard, or sensed in any other way, but we know it exists.</p>
<p>A collective noun denotes a group or collection of people or things.</p>
<p>Examples :  That pack of lies is disgraceful.</p>
<p>Pack as used here is a collective noun. Collective nouns take a singular verb, as they refer to the collection of people or things they identify as one entity—in this case, the singular verb is.</p>
<p>Examples :  A pride of lions roamed the savanna.</p>
<p>Pride is also a collective noun.</p>
<h2 id="nouns-and-number">Nouns and number</h2>
<p>All nouns are either singular or plural in number. A singular noun refers to one person, place, thing, or idea and requires a singular verb, while a plural noun refers to more than one person, place, thing, or idea and requires a plural verb.</p>
<p>Forming plural nouns</p>
<p>Many English plural nouns can be formed by adding -s or -es to the singular form, although there are also many exceptions.</p>
<p>Examples :  cat→cats</p>
<pre><code>               These two cats are both black. 
</code></pre>
<p>Note the plural verb are.</p>
<p>Examples :  tax→taxes</p>
<pre><code>               house→houses 
</code></pre>
<h2 id="countable-nouns-vs.-uncountable-nouns">Countable nouns vs. Uncountable nouns</h2>
<p>Concrete and abstract common nouns can be further classified as either countable or uncountable. Countable nouns are nouns that can be counted, even if the resulting number would be extraordinarily high (like the number of humans in the world). Countable nouns can be singular or plural and can be used with numbers and modifiers like a/an, the, some, any, a few, and many.</p>
<p>Examples :  Here is a cat.</p>
<pre><code>              Here are a few cats. 

              Here are eight cats. 
</code></pre>
<p>Uncountable nouns, or mass nouns, are nouns that are impossible to count, whether because they name intangible concepts (e.g., information, animal husbandry, wealth), collections of things that are considered as wholes (e.g., jewelry, equipment, the working class), or homogeneous physical substances (e.g., milk, sand, air). Although most of these nouns are singular in form, because they refer to things that can’t be isolated and counted on their own, they are never used with the singular indefinite article a or an. Singular concrete uncountable nouns can often be expressed in countable units by adding a countable noun like piece (with of). On their own, uncountable nouns can be modified by the definite article, the, or indefinite adjectives like some.</p>
<p>Examples :</p>
<p>They’d love to rent some property around here.</p>
<p>They’d love to rent a piece of property around here.</p>
<p>Students don’t seem to have much homework these days.</p>
<p>Could you help me move the furniture into the other room?</p>
<h2 id="nouns-as-subjects">Nouns as subjects</h2>
<p>Every sentence must have a subject, and that subject will always be a noun or pronoun. The subject of a sentence is the person, place, or thing that is doing or being or experiencing whatever is described by the verb of the sentence.</p>
<p>Examples :  Maria played the piece beautifully.</p>
<p>The noun Maria is the subject of this sentence; it tells us who is performing the action described by the sentence’s verb (played).</p>
<h2 id="nouns-as-objects">Nouns as objects</h2>
<p>Nouns can also be objects of a transitive verb in a sentence. An object can be either a direct object (a noun that receives the action described by the verb) or an indirect object (a noun that receives direct object).</p>
<p>Examples :</p>
<p>Cleo passed the salt.</p>
<p>Cleo passed Otto the salt.</p>
<p>In both of the above sentences, the noun salt is the direct object of the verb passed; the salt is what Cleo passed. In the second sentence, there is also an indirect object: the noun Otto. Otto is the person to whom Cleo passed the salt; Otto is the recipient of the salt. A good way to identify an indirect object in a sentence is to ask yourself to whom/what or for whom/what something is being done.</p>
<h2 id="nouns-as-subject-and-object-complements">Nouns as subject and object complements</h2>
<p>Another role nouns sometimes perform in a sentence is that of a subject complement. A subject complement normally follows a linking verb such as be, become, or seem and gives more information about the subject of the sentence.</p>
<p>Examples :  Mary is a teacher.</p>
<p>In this sentence, the noun teacher is being used as a subject complement. A teacher is what Mary is.</p>
