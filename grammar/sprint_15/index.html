   <div class="stackedit__html"><h1 id="verbs-the-definitive-guide">Verbs: The Definitive Guide</h1>
<p>Want to know where all the action is? Verbs! Verbs are words that represent actions that are external (run, jump, work) and internal (love, think, consider). Without verbs, you can’t do anything, you can’t feel anything—you can’t even be anything.</p>
<p>As the heart of sentences and clauses, verbs show what the subject is doing or feeling, even if they’re just existing. Verbs are also the only type of word that’s absolutely necessary to make a sentence. Not even nouns, which represent things, need to be in every sentence.</p>
<p>Because verbs are so important, they have more rules than other types of words. This can make verbs a little confusing in English, but read on for our explanation of everything you need to know: the different types of verbs, the different forms they take, how to conjugate them in every tense, and some expert tips on how to use them when speaking or writing.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-verb">What is a verb?</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the basics: What is a verb? Verbs are words that describe actions, whether physical or mental. Verbs also describe a “state of being,” like the verbs be, become, or exist.</p>
<p>Salah ran across the field, kicked the ball, and scored a goal.</p>
<p>“I am the State.” —King Louis XIV</p>
<p>Some verbs also act as “helper verbs” to change the tense of another verb. Likewise, these helper verbs can change a positive statement to a negative one with words like “not.”</p>
<p>She has been jogging for a month and already feels her stamina increasing.</p>
<p>“I don’t feel so good.” —Spider-Man</p>
<p>Every sentence needs at least one verb. If there’s no verb, it’s an incomplete sentence or a sentence fragment. Except for imperative sentences (commands), a sentence also needs a subject, the thing doing the action.</p>
<p>Subjects are important for a verb because they change how it’s conjugated, which we explain below. This is especially true for the most common verb: be.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-verbs">Types of verbs</h2>
<p>Dynamic (action) verbs</p>
<p>Most verbs describe a physical action or activity, something external that can be seen or heard. These verbs are formally known as dynamic verbs, but can also be called action or event verbs.</p>
<p>Examples: walk, laugh, swim, play, eat, drink, sing, dance, talk, say</p>
<p>There are a lot of actions that take place in our minds and feelings, which are not external. Verbs that describe mental or internal actions are still dynamic verbs, but they’re not always so obvious. These include “process verbs,” which describe actions of transition.</p>
<p>Examples: consider, guess, change, grow, live, endure, succeed, fail</p>
<h2 id="stative-state-of-being-verbs">Stative (state-of-being) verbs</h2>
<p>The opposite of dynamic verbs of action is stative verbs of being. Stative verbs describe a subject’s state or feeling, including things they like and don’t like.</p>
<p>Examples: want, need, prefer, love, hate, like, dislike, seem, understand, know, believe, involve, realize</p>
<p>One of the most important parts of stative verbs is that you can’t use them in the continuous tenses. Stative verbs stick to the simple tenses, or occasionally use the perfect.</p>
<p>The trouble is that some verbs can be dynamic or stative, depending on the specific meaning and how they’re used. This includes the most popular verb be. Let’s take a deeper look at these.</p>
<h2 id="verbs-that-can-be-dynamic-or-stative">Verbs that can be dynamic or stative</h2>
<p>A lot of verbs have more than one meaning, so they can be used as dynamic or stative. These include perception words: see, hear, taste, smell, feel.</p>
<p>When perception verbs are used as an involuntary action, such as passive or unintentional actions, they are stative. This applies when these verbs are used in the general sense, a state of being that’s always happening.</p>
<p>I can’t see without my glasses.</p>
<p>Cake still tastes great even if it’s not your birthday.</p>
<p>When those same verbs are used for a voluntary action—specific, deliberate, and/or temporary events—they are dynamic. Among other things, it means they can be used in the continuous tenses.</p>
<p>I haven’t been seeing well since I lost my glasses.</p>
<p>We were tasting cakes for the wedding all afternoon.</p>
<p>Likewise, some perception verbs have alternative meanings, especially if they’re part of expressions or phrasal verbs. Often, this means they act as dynamic verbs.</p>
<p>Romeo and Juliet had been seeing each other for just five days when they died.</p>
<p>Other verbs, like think, have, and, above all be, follow the same voluntary/involuntary rules as perception verbs. Depending on how they’re used, they can be either dynamic or stative.</p>
<p>I think toads are better than frogs.</p>
<p>(stative: expresses an opinion or feeling always there; involuntary)</p>
<p>All morning I was thinking about how toads are better than frogs.</p>
<p>(dynamic: expresses the temporary action of thinking; voluntary)</p>
<p>I have a ten-year-old dog.</p>
<p>(stative: expresses permanent ownership; involuntary)</p>
<p>I am having a party for my dog’s eleventh birthday.</p>
<p>(dynamic: used as part of phrase; voluntary)</p>
<p>He is nice to everyone.</p>
<p>(stative: expresses an ongoing state or personality trait; involuntary)</p>
<p>He was just being nice to everyone to get a promotion.</p>
<p>(dynamic: expresses a temporary/intentional state; voluntary)</p>
