            <h1 id="what-is-an-adjective">What Is an Adjective?</h1>
            <p>An adjective is a part of speech that can be used to describe or provide more information about
                a noun or pronoun that acts as the subject in a sentence. Adjectives are found after the verb or before
                the noun it modifies.</p>
            <h2 id="definition-of-an-adjective">Definition of an Adjective</h2>
            <p>According to the Cambridge Dictionary, an adjective is defined as “a word that describes a noun or
                pronoun.” The Collins Dictionary gives a more elaborate definition. According to it, “an adjective is a
                word such as ‘big’, ‘ dead’, or ‘ financial’ that describes a person or thing, or gives extra
                information about them. Adjectives usually come before nouns or after link verbs.”</p>
            <p>The Oxford Learner’s Dictionary defines an adjective as “a word that describes a person or thing, for
                example ‘big’, ‘red’ and ‘clever’ in a big house, red wine and a clever idea.” An adjective is “a word
                belonging to one of the major form classes in any of numerous languages and typically serving as a
                modifier of a noun to denote a quality of the thing named, to indicate its quantity or extent, or to
                specify a thing as distinct from something else”, according to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary.</p>
            <h3 id="forms-of-adjectives-–-degrees-of-comparison">Forms of Adjectives – Degrees of Comparison</h3>
            <p>Did you know that adjectives can be used to compare similar qualities of different subjects that perform
                the same action. There are three forms of adjectives or rather three degrees of comparison. The are:</p>
            <p>Positive or Absolute Form</p>
            <p>Comparative Form</p>
            <p>Superlative Form</p>
            <h3 id="positive-degree-of-comparison">Positive Degree of Comparison:</h3>
            <p>The positive form or the positive degree of comparison is the form of the adjective used in the original
                form. For example: This book is interesting. This form of adjective is used when there is no other
                subject to be compared.</p>
            <h3 id="comparative-degree-of-comparison">Comparative Degree of Comparison</h3>
            <p>The comparative form of the adjective is used when two subjects performing the same action or possessing
                the same quality are compared. For example: The book I read yesterday was more interesting than the one
                I read today.</p>
            <h3 id="superlative-degree-of-comparison">Superlative Degree of Comparison</h3>
            <p>The superlative degree of comparison is used when comparing the same quality of two or more subjects and
                to represent that a subject is superior to two or more subjects in performing an action. For example:
                This fantasy novel is the most interesting book that I have ever read.</p>
            <h2 id="types-of-adjectives">Types of Adjectives</h2>
            <p>Adjectives can be divided into different categories based on their functions when used in a sentence. The
                different types of adjectives are:</p>
            <p>Possessive Adjectives</p>
            <p>Interrogative Adjectives</p>
            <p>Demonstrative Adjectives</p>
            <p>Compound Adjectives</p>
            <p>Possessive Adjectives:</p>
            <p>These adjectives, like possessive pronouns, are used to show or represent possession of a quality. For
                example: my, your, his, her, their, its, whose, etc.</p>
            <h3 id="interrogative-adjectives">Interrogative Adjectives:</h3>
            <p>An adjective that is used to modify a noun or a pronoun by asking a question is called an interrogative
                adjective. There are only a few adjectives that can be termed as interrogative adjectives. They are
                whose, what and which.</p>
            <h3 id="demonstrative-adjectives">Demonstrative Adjectives:</h3>
            <p>Demonstrative adjectives are mainly used to describe the position of a subject (a noun or pronoun) in
                space or time. This, that, these and those are the demonstrative adjectives in English.</p>
            <h3 id="compound-adjectives">Compound Adjectives:</h3>
            <p>Compound adjectives consist of two or more adjectives that are combined together to form an adjective
                that can be used to modify the subject. Some examples of compound adjectives are cotton-tailed,
                curly-haired, absent-minded, happy-go-lucky, etc.</p>
            <h2 id="how-to-use-adjectives-in-sentences">How to Use Adjectives in Sentences?</h2>
            <p>Adjectives are known to give your writing and speech a very flowery look. It aids in making it
                descriptive and also in giving your readers and listeners a visual treat. However, stuffing it with too
                many adjectives can make it look or sound vague and unclear. This would only lead to misunderstanding of
                your content. Knowing when, where and how to use adjectives is a skill that you should master.</p>
            <p>Any piece of writing should be clear and precise. Find out if there is a word that specifically means
                whatever you are trying to convey. For example: quick, swift, hasty, fleet, etc. are all adjectives that
                mean ‘very fast’. Likewise, contented, cheerful, merry, joyful, ecstatic, delighted, etc. are all words
                that describe different degrees of happiness. There is also another concept that you should know. There
                is a particular order in which you should place adjectives when you are using two or more adjectives to
                describe the same subject or object. Check out the order of adjectives to learn more.</p>
