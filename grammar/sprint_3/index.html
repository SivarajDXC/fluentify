        <div class="stackedit__html"><h1 id="what-is-an-adverb">What Is an Adverb?</h1>
            <p>Like an adjective gives us more information about the noun in a sentence, an adverb is used to provide more information about the verb or the action in the sentence. It also has the property of describing the adjective or another adverb.</p>
            <h2 id="definition-of-an-adverb">Definition of an Adverb</h2>
            <p>An adverb, according to the Oxford Learner’s Dictionary, is “a word that adds more information about place, time, manner, cause or degree to a verb, an adjective, a phrase or another adverb.” The Cambridge Dictionary defines an adverb as “a word that describes or gives more information about a verb, adjective, adverb, or phrase.”</p>
            <p>The Merriam-Webster Dictionary provides a similar definition. It defines an adverb as “a word used to modify a verb, an adjective, or another adverb and often used to show degree, manner, place, or time.” According to the Collins Dictionary, an adverb is defined as “a word such as ‘slowly’, ‘ now’, ‘very’, ‘politically’, or ‘ fortunately’ which adds information about the action, event, or situation mentioned in a clause.”</p>
            <h2 id="different-types-of-adverbs-with-examples">Different Types of Adverbs with Examples</h2>
            <p>Let us now take a look at each of these adverb types in detail.</p>
            <h3 id="adverbs-of-manner">Adverbs of Manner:</h3>
            <p>These adverbs are those that describe the manner in which an action is done. Basically, it can be said that the adverbs of manner answer the question ‘how’.</p>
            <p>Examples of adverbs of manner:</p>
            <p>Quickly, promptly, clearly, slowly, gradually, eventually, rapidly, seriously, instantly, keenly, etc.</p>
            <h3 id="adverbs-of-time">Adverbs of Time:</h3>
            <p>As the name suggests, the adverbs of time are used to tell the reader when some action is occurring. Adverbs of time include general time periods and specific times. We can identify an adverb of time by asking the question ‘when’.</p>
            <p>Examples of adverbs of time:</p>
            <p>Now, soon, today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, next month, recently, forever, etc.</p>
            <h3 id="adverbs-of-place">Adverbs of Place:</h3>
            <p>These adverbs are used to indicate where the action mentioned in the sentence is taking place. Adverbs of place can be identified by asking the question ‘where’.</p>
            <p>Examples of adverbs of place:</p>
            <p>Somewhere, anywhere, nowhere, here, outside, inside, wherever, elsewhere, left, right, north, east, south, west, etc.</p>
            <h3 id="adverbs-of-frequency">Adverbs of Frequency:</h3>
            <p>These adverbs are used to denote how often an action or event is happening. The adverbs of frequency can be recognised by asking the question ‘how often’.</p>
            <p>Examples of adverbs of frequency:</p>
            <p>Seldom, rarely, never, often, weekly, monthly, yearly, annually, usually, sometimes, occasionally, constantly, frequently, etc.</p>
            <h3 id="adverbs-of-degree">Adverbs of Degree:</h3>
            <p>These adverbs are used to indicate how intense an action of quality is. It is used to describe adjectives and adverbs. For instance, an adverb of manner expresses how fast or how slow a vehicle is moving, how hot or cold the weather is, how interesting or boring a movie is and so on.</p>
            <p>Examples of adverbs of degree:</p>
            <p>Very, too, extremely, much, more, most, little, less, incredibly, totally, greatly, hardly, deeply, barely, etc.</p>
            <h2 id="conjunctive-adverbs">Conjunctive Adverbs:</h2>
            <p>Conjunctive adverbs perform a little differently from the other types of adverbs. These adverbs are seen to act like a conjunction to link two sentences or clauses together and hence the name, ‘conjunctive adverbs’.</p>
            <p>Examples of conjunctive adverbs:</p>
            <p>However, nevertheless, meanwhile, therefore, instead, likewise, notably, subsequently, rather, namely, on the other hand, incidentally, in addition to, etc.</p>
            <h2 id="how-adverbs-are-used-in-sentences">How Adverbs are Used in Sentences</h2>
            <p>Unlike other parts of speech, adverbs can be placed at any part of the sentence (beginning, middle or end), and make complete sense without sounding absurd. Another characteristic is that multiple adverbs can be used in a sentence. Have a look at the following examples to have a clear understanding of the same.</p>
            <p>I was planning to go to the supermarket to buy some groceries. However, I did not find the time to go. So I ordered online.</p>
            <p>My mom did not cook breakfast today. Therefore, we ended up making noodles for everyone.</p>
            <p>Normally, we go to church on Sundays.</p>
            <p>Don’t you think the coffee is too sweet?</p>
            <p>Do not worry. You will gradually learn how to do it.</p>
            <p>The song I was listening to yesterday was very soothing.</p>
            <p>He kept talking to me for such a long time but I barely knew him.</p>
            <p>It is extremely hot outside today.</p>
            <p>How often do you work out?</p>
            <p>Can I come home tomorrow?</p>
