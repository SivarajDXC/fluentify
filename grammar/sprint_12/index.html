<p>Prepositions indicate relationships between other words in a sentence.</p>
<p>Many prepositions tell you where something is or when something happened.</p>
<p>Most prepositions have several definitions, so their meaning depends quite a bit on context.</p>
<p>Ending a sentence with a preposition is not a grammatical error.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-preposition">What is a preposition?</h2>
<p>“Vampires! Zombies! Werewolves!”</p>
<p>“Where?!”</p>
<p>“Behind you!”</p>
<p>Thank goodness for prepositions. Imagine not knowing where the danger lay . . .</p>
<p>Prepositions tell us where or when something is in relation to something else. When monsters are approaching, it’s good to have these special words to tell us where those monsters are. Are they behind us or in front of us? Will they be arriving in three seconds or at midnight?</p>
<p>Prepositions often tell us where one noun is in relation to another (e.g., “The coffee is on the table beside you”). But they can also indicate more abstract ideas, such as purpose or contrast (e.g., “We went for a walk despite the rain”).</p>
<h2 id="types-of-prepositions">Types of prepositions</h2>
<p>Prepositions indicate direction, time, location, and spatial relationships, as well as other abstract types of relationships.</p>
<p>Direction: Look to the left and you’ll see our destination.</p>
<p>Time: We’ve been working since this morning.</p>
<p>Location: We saw a movie at the theater.</p>
<p>Space: The dog hid under the table</p>
<h3 id="preposition-examples">Preposition examples</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s no reliable formula for determining which preposition to use with a particular combination of words. The best way to learn which prepositions go with which words is to read as much high-quality writing as you can and pay attention to which combinations sound right. Here are a few examples of the most common prepositions used in sentences.</p>
<p>Examples : I should rewrite the introduction of my essay.</p>
<p>Examples : Sam left his jacket in the car.</p>
<p>Examples : Did you send that letter to your mother?</p>
<p>Examples : We’re cooking for ten guests tonight.</p>
<p>Examples : Dani ate lunch with their boss.</p>
