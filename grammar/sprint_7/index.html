        <div class="stackedit__html"><h1 id="metaphor">1. Metaphor:</h1>
            <p>A metaphor is a figure of speech that directly compares two unrelated things, suggesting a similarity between them. It does not use “like” or “as” to make the comparison. Instead, it asserts that one thing is another thing.</p>
            <p>Example: “Her voice is velvet.” In this metaphor, the person’s voice is compared to velvet, implying that it is smooth, rich, and pleasant.</p>
            <h1 id="simile">2. Simile:</h1>
            <p>A simile is a figure of speech that also compares two unrelated things, but it uses “like” or “as” to make the comparison. It explicitly states that one thing is similar to another thing.</p>
            <p>Example: “Her smile was like sunshine.” This simile compares the brightness and warmth of the person’s smile to the qualities of sunshine.</p>
            <h1 id="figures-of-speech">3. Figures of Speech:</h1>
            <p>Figures of speech are creative and rhetorical devices that add richness and depth to language. They go beyond literal meanings and enhance the expression of ideas.</p>
            <p>Example 1: Personification - “The flowers danced in the breeze.” Personification attributes human characteristics (dancing) to non-human objects (flowers), making the description more vivid and engaging.</p>
            <p>Example 2: Hyperbole - “I’ve told you a million times!” Hyperbole is an exaggerated statement that is not meant to be taken literally. It emphasizes a point or creates a strong effect.</p>
            <p>Example 3: Alliteration - “Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.” Alliteration is the repetition of consonant sounds at the beginning of words in close proximity. It creates a musical and memorable effect.</p>
            <p>Example 4: Oxymoron - “Bittersweet” or “Jumbo shrimp.” An oxymoron combines contradictory terms to create a unique meaning or impression.</p>
            <p>Example 5: Onomatopoeia - “Buzz,” “hiss,” “crack.” Onomatopoeia refers to words that imitate or suggest the sounds they describe, adding sensory detail to the writing.</p>
            <p>These figures of speech and literary devices add creativity, imagery, and emphasis to written and spoken language, making them powerful tools for communication and expression.</p>
            <h2 id="omission-of-articles">Omission of articles</h2>
            <p>Occasionally, articles are omitted altogether before certain nouns. In these cases, the article is implied but not actually present. This implied article is sometimes called a “zero article.” Often, the article is omitted before a noun that refers to an abstract idea. Look at the following examples:</p>
            <p>Incorrect : Let’s go out for a dinner tonight.</p>
            <p>Correct : Let’s go out for dinner tonight.</p>
            <p>Incorrect : The creativity is a valuable quality in children.</p>
            <p>Correct : Creativity is a valuable quality in children.</p>
            <p>Tip: The words for many languages and nationalities are not preceded by an article.</p>
            <p>Incorrect : I studied the French in high school for four years.</p>
            <p>Correct : I studied French in high school for four years.</p>
            <p>Tip: Sports and academic subjects do not require articles.</p>
            <p>Incorrect : I like to play the baseball.</p>
            <p>Correct : I like to play baseball.</p>
            <p>Incorrect : My sister was always good at the math.</p>
            <p>Correct : My sister was always good at math.</p>
